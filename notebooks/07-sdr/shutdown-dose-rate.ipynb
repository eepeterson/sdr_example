    "# Performing Shutdown Dose Rate Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we'll be learning how to calculate the Shutdown Dose Rate (SDR) for a very simple system. In this section, we will introduce [OpenMC's depletion capabilities](https://openmc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for performing SDR calculations using the Rigorous 2-Step (R2S) method. The R2S process allows one to calculate dose rate maps from the transport of radioactive decay products like gamma rays after a given irradiation scenario. The process couples an initial neutron transport simulation for computing flux spectrum integrated reaction rates for a defined spatial discretization to an inventory solver to compute nuclide inventories given an irradiation scenario. Once the new (likely radioactive) material compositions are computed, they are turned into photon sources based on the nuclear data contained in depletion chains. These photon sources are then used for a second transport simulation to compute the dose rate at desired locations. In this tutorial, we will only consider cell-wise spatial discretization for simplicity. However, mesh-based R2S calculations are currently feasible in OpenMC.\n",

To do this we can leverage the `EnergyFunctionFilter` capabilities that allow us to perform a transformation to the photon flux based on the incoming energy during the simulation.
